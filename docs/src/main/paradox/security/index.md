# Security Announcements

## Receiving Security Advisories

The best way to receive any and all security announcements is to subscribe to the [Pekko security list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/akka-security).

The mailing list is very low traffic, and receives notifications only after security reports have been managed by the core team and fixes are publicly available.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

We strongly encourage people to report such problems to our private security mailing list first, before disclosing them in a public forum.

Following best practice, we strongly encourage anyone to report potential security 
vulnerabilities to [security@pekko.io](mailto:security@pekko.io) before disclosing them in a public forum like the mailing list or as a GitHub issue.

Reports to this email address will be handled by our security team, who will work together with you
to ensure that a fix can be provided without delay.
